I've been a member of Nottingham Hackspace and interested in the maker movement for nearly a decade now, but I always found that I would get very little done whilst actually at the Hackspace - too many interesting projects / organisational problems to get involved with!

So just over a 18 months ago when I decided that I wanted to get better at woodworking I knew that it wouldn't happen in the Hackspace! I decided that I would convert my garage into a small workshop. A garage that was full of _things_. Lots and lots of *things*!

I spent the next few weeks alternating between watching lots of woodworking videos on Youtube and looking at the garage, willing it to clear itself. Unsurprisingly, it didn't.

After a long weekend clearing, including 3 trips to the tip, I finally had an almost empty garage and started to put down some foam mats to even out the horribly cracked concrete floor.
