As well as some general interests, this page will document what I am currently working on in the hopes that public commitment will lead to actual progress!

### What am I working on right now?

- This website! Inspired by [Jamie Tanna](https://www.jvt.me/) I want to own more of my data, so will be working with IndieWeb standards to do just that.
  - Yes, that link to Jamie should definitely be a `h-card`!
- Garage {{< icon arrow-right >}} Woodshop Conversion, I'm trying to learn woodworking, and have been converting my garage to a basic woodshop. Expect to see lots of posts about that!
- [AICC Video](https://github.com/geeksareforlife/aicc-video) - a basic system to generate an eLearning wrapper around a YouTube or Vimeo video and allow it to be tracked as a learning object.
- School COVID response - as a governor I work with the Senior Leadership Team to work on how we handle opening the school during these weird times.
