2020 has been an interesting year!

The lockdown as a result of the [Coronavirus Pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) has been one of the weirdest times of mine, and I think probably everyone's, life.

From its early beginnings as something maybe a little worse than flu, through to not really leaving our homes for weeks on end, each day has brought new and exciting changes for us to get used to.

It has also, I believe, highlighted deficiencies in our leaders. Comparing the likes of [Boris Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson) to [Jacinda Ardern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacinda_Ardern) just shows us how different responses have led to radically different outcomes.

That said, there are some things about the UK Government that have impressed me. The furlough scheme was implemented quickly and was very wide ranging, especially for a Conservative government.

But where I have really seen disparities is in the education sector.

The Government were very slow to close schools, which led to a lot of unnecessary stress for parents, teachers and governors. They also maintained up until the very last minute that schools would not, in fact, close anytime soon. School closures were announced with just 48 hours notice, with guidance for schools going up with less than 24 hours to prepare. 

As a school governor, I normally attend a "Full Governors" meeting every 6-7 weeks, with regular, short visits into school in between. With school closures announced the governing board had to rally round the leadership team, provide support and ratify plans on an almost daily basis at first.

With these regular, virtual, meetings we were able to see the school's response in almost realtime, and I am even more impressed with professionalism of the staff. Plans were made (and remade when the guidance updated) and hardly a beat was missed as we went from a bustling 420 child school to a socially distanced 20 child school.

I watched as staff learnt new technologies and delivered lessons and materials to their pupils wherever they are. As they worked to include them in activities and eduction, and overcome whatever barriers those children have.

Unfortunately, I am also watching as children become more socially isolated and less and less interested in school work. As parents like Caroline and I work to try and keep our children connected with their friends, connected with their extra-curricular activities and try to ensure that they don't fall behind in their academic progress.

I watch as the government makes grand promises about what is next for our children, without offering the tools and resources that schools need to make it a reality.

So I look to September with very mixed feelings; On the one hand children need to return to school. Not just for their education, but for all of the social and mental wellbeing benefits that stem from it; On the other I worry about putting our children in harms way, and that a (seemingly inevitable) second wave of the virus would force us back into lockdown, with children once again reminded of the social interaction that they are missing.

So for the next few weeks as a school governor I need to help my school hope for the best, but plan for the worst and make sure that our children are not collateral damage in the fight to eradicate coronavirus.
